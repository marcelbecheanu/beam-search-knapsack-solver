# Beam Search Knapsack Solver

### Project description.
This project implements a Beam Search algorithm in Java to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem, also known as the binary knapsack problem. This problem consists of choosing items from a set to maximize the total value, subject to a backpack weight limit. The Beam Search algorithm is a heuristic search technique that allows for quick approximate solutions, even for large-scale problems.
